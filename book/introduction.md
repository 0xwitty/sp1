<!-- TODO: We should change this image to be "SP1, A performant, feature-complete zkVM for production usage."-->

SP1 is a performant, open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that verifies the execution of arbitrary Rust (or any LLVM-compiled language) programs.

## The future of ZK is writing normal code

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are one of the most critical technologies to blockchain scaling, interoperability and privacy. But, historically building ZKP systems was extrememly complicated--requiring large teams with specialized cryptography expertise and taking years to go to production. 

SP1 provides a performant, general-purpose zkVM that enables **any developer** to use ZKPs by writing normal code (in Rust), and get cheap and fast proofs. SP1 will enable ZKPs to become mainstream, introducing a a new era of verifiability for all of blockchain infrastructure and beyond.
