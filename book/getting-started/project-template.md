# Project Template

Another option for getting started with SP1 is to use the [SP1 Project Template](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-project-template/tree/main).

You can use this as a Github template to create a new repository that has a SP1 program, a script to generate proofs, and also a contracts folder that contains a Solidity contract that can verify SP1 proofs on any EVM chain.

<!-- TODO: is the project template linked with the example from cargo prove new? I feel like they should be the same. -->
<!-- I have a few notes on the project template 
* Add a note in the "fibonacciProgramVkey" on how to get it from the script/vkey.rs file
* Beef up the readme for instructions how to use the project template onchain.
* Direct people to prover network
